In this project, I created a vignette for the National Hockey League (NHL) Application Programming Interfaces (API). The first section contains functions that will pull the data from the endpoints of the API The second section focuses on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of data pulled from a few of the endpoints. There were no particularly astounding findings, but I found it interesting that the defensemen of the Carolina Hurricanes had more points on average than the right wingers. This may be due to my limited knowledge on hockey and what the roles of each position are, but I was surprised that players whose position has defense in the name had many assists, which I think of as a more offense-oriented action. 

Overall, I found the setup for GitHub the most confusing since I am unfamiliar with it and struggled a bit with writing the functions in a way that made the most sense logically, while addressing concerns such as the lack of data for the Seattle Kraken team in the NHL stats API. Coding-wise, I had some difficulties with writing the function for the NHL records API because the first two endpoints did not require names or ids, but the other four could specify the name or id. Then for the four that could specify the team, the first three used the franchise id, while the last endpoint used the most recent id. So, when I made the first function, I had to make sure the first two endpoints would output all the teams and disregard name or id specifications. The next four endpoints took in the id, but for the first three “id” specified the franchise id and for the final one “id” specified the most recent id. I thought about somehow figuring out how to make the two match, but it is difficult to choose if the franchise id or the most recent id would be the overarching “id” for the teams. So, I made it so if both the team name and id were given, the team name would override the id input. The second function was also a bit tricky since only using the link outputted a single observation and the “stats” portion was within one of the columns. Although there were many difficulties, having the final code that runs smoothing is very satisfying. 

For a similar project in the future, I would like to put more effort into researching the background on the topic. For example, I am still not sure what exactly a shutout is for goalies so I was not sure how important it was in determining their performance. My focus for the EDA was the bigger picture for the hockey teams. For example, I tried to think about what the coaches or owners would find the most useful when looking at the data, which was why most of the exploratory data analysis was on the active skaters and goalies on the teams. My thoughts were to compare the different skaters and goalies across the many teams to compare and contrast what would make the players perform better, but due to my lack of knowledge on hockey I felt that the results were lackluster. Overall, I learned a lot during the process of completing the project.
